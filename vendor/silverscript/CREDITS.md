# Credits and Third-Party Licenses

SilverScript is a programming language for Kaspa smart contracts. While the SilverScript compiler is an original implementation, this project incorporates and builds upon work from the CashScript project.

## Acknowledgements

- **CashScript**: SilverScript is heavily inspired by the [CashScript](https://cashscript.org/) language. We are grateful to Rosco Kalis and the CashScript contributors for their work in advancing script-based smart contract languages.

## Third-Party Components

### 1. Language Grammar and Syntax
The SilverScript grammar specification (located in `src/silverscript.pest`) is a derivative work based on the [CashScript grammar documentation](https://cashscript.org/docs/compiler/grammar).

### 2. Contract Examples
Many smart contract examples included in this repository (e.g., in the `/tests` directory) are sourced or adapted from the CashScript repository.
